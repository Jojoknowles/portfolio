 <p>14 december, Nieuw Dakota, Amsterdam.</p>
	

	“Uncertainly dinner” is an interactive performance in which the memory of a dinner that’s already been had is preserved through the frantic drawing of it on the table. Pencil and charcoal is used to note-take the remnants of the food that was eaten, the conversations that were had, the drinks that were spilled, in an attempt to jot down its dear memory.<br><br> The audience was encouraged to join in, prompted to think about the last meal they ate, their favorite meal, or the meal they would choose as their last.<br><br>

	<i>"Nieuw Dakota, like a precious dinner, is now being digested. We have all swallowed bits of its past and let them down our esophagus to be churned and dissolved in us. The jester of this evening is making one last attempt at a feast, albeit one of paper that at the end of the evening can be crumpled up in one hand".</i> <br><br>

	Commisioned by Nieuw Dakota for their last event before closing their doors.<br><br>
